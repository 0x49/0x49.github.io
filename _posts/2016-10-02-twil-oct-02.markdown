# Artificial Intelligence

> We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth. - Vernor Vinge

I firmly believe that we will eventually build Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). There is no way (unless some unfortunate catastrophe happens to human kind) that we will ever stop making advancement in technology, information processing, etc. One day, we will get there. In his recent TED talk, Sam Harris discusses whether we should be scared of ASI or if we can build one that we can control.
